# Machine Learning Project README

This README provides an overview of a machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices using the California housing dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to predict housing prices based on various features using the XGBoost regression algorithm. The California housing dataset is used, and the project is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Required libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost are imported to handle data, visualize results, and train the model.

2. **Installation**: Ensure you have XGBoost library installed by running `pip install xgboost`.

3. **Data Loading**: The California housing dataset is loaded using the `fetch_california_housing` function from `sklearn.datasets`.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is transformed into a DataFrame format for better readability. Features and target variables are separated. The dataset is explored for null values, duplicates, and a correlation heatmap is created to visualize feature relationships.

5. **Model Creation and Training**: An XGBoost Regressor model is created and trained using the training data. The `train_test_split` function is used to split the data into training and testing sets.

6. **Model Prediction**: The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data.

7. **Evaluation Metrics**: Two evaluation metrics are calculated:
   - R-squared (coefficient of determination): Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable.
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

## How to Use

1. Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn xgboost`.

2. Run the Provided Code: Copy and paste the provided code into your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).

3. Understand the Code: Each section of the code is commented to explain its purpose and functionality.

4. Analyze the Results: The code provides R-squared and MAE values as evaluation metrics. Analyze these metrics to understand the performance of the model.

## Ethical Consideration

Note that the original Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem related to racial assumptions. In this project, the California housing dataset is used as an alternative.
